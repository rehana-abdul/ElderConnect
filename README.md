# Immersive Elder Connect

## Project Overview

**Immersive Elder Connect** is a technology-driven application designed to enhance the physical, mental, and social well-being of elderly individuals, particularly those living in old age homes. The project leverages **Virtual Reality (VR)** and **Augmented Reality (AR)** to provide immersive experiences, promote healthy physical activity, and foster community support through a dedicated help network.

The core goal of this project is to reduce loneliness, encourage active lifestyles, and improve overall quality of life for elderly users using accessible and engaging digital solutions.

## Problem Statement

Elderly individuals often face challenges such as:

* Social isolation and loneliness
* Limited physical activity
* Lack of access to engaging recreational experiences
* Dependence on paid instructors or external resources for wellness activities

Traditional solutions are either costly, inaccessible, or lack personalization. **Immersive Elder Connect** addresses these gaps using immersive technologies and a community-driven approach.

## Solution Overview

Immersive Elder Connect provides a unified platform with three major modules:

1. **Virtual Travel (VR-based)** – Enables elders to experience famous historical and tourist locations virtually.
2. **Physical Exercise (AR-based)** – Offers guided yoga and exercise sessions tailored for elderly users.
3. **Community Help Module** – Connects elders and caregivers with NGOs and support organizations.
